Project Story for Wine App (Still thinking of a good name for this app)

Currently I plan on the app to consist of a Home Page, a Red Wine Collection page, a White Wine Collection page,
a Futures page, and hopefully, a How to Wine Taste video page (not sure about this one at this time but why not?)

Home page:

Picture (logo?) with brief description and 4 buttons (Red Wine, White Wine, Futures, Video(?))
	1) Red Wine button will take you to the Red Wine page.  
	2) White Wine button will take you to the White Wine page.
	3) Futures button will take you to the Futures input page.
	4) Video button will take you a video of How to Taste Wine (if I can find one on YouTube and add it in)
	[i] will take you information about the app - not sure if this will be a separate page or just display on the screen
	
Red Wine button will take you to the Red Wine Collection page.  
	Home in Banner will take you back to the Home page.
	1) Input for name of Winery
	2) Input for the variety of wine
	3) Input for Vintage (year of the wine)
	4) Notes - just a place to enter what you think of the wine, perhaps vintner's notes, maybe what food to pair it with, etc.
	5) Display button - to display all the bottles in Red Wine Collection
	6) Futures button - to take you to the Futures page
	7) Submit button - to add a wine (Inputs 1 - 4) to the collection.
	[i] will take you information about the app - not sure if this will be a separate page or just display on the screen
